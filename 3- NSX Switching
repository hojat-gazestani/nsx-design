3-1 Logical Switch Fundamentals
  Standard Virtual Switch
  Distributed Virtual Switch
  Logical Switch
    is based on a kernel module
    is backed by the vSphere Distributed Switch
    identified using a pool of VNIs
    provides VTEP functionality to support VXLAN
    can span multiple Distrbuted Virtual Switches
   
  VXALN
    Provides tunneled transport over the physical network
    allows L2 networks to span L3 devices
    VNIs provide segmentation similar to VLAN
    
    ARP Reauest Without VXLAN                               // ????????????????????????????????

3-2 Transport Zones

3-3 NSX Controller Cluster
  provides interlligence and features to the logical Switch
  Eliminates the need for Multicast configuration in the physical network
    // VXLAN isnt just a VMware Technology. other vendors such as Cisco and Juniper support VXLAN, but they generally require multicast configuration
  The NSX Controller reduces broadcast traffic by suppressing ARP requests     // multicast ??????????????????????
  
  MAC, ARP, VTEP Tables
    show control-cluster logical-switches mac-table 5001
    show control-cluster logical-switches arp-table 5001
    show control-cluster logical-switches vtep-table 5001
    
  Populating the MAC Table
  Populating the VTEP Table
  Populating the ARP Table
  
  NSX Manager is used to deployed the NSX Controller Cluster
    NSX Manager has the required OVF template built in
  the NSX Conroller node must be deployed as a cluster
  
  the User World Agent (UWA) is used to communicate with hosts
    the NSX Manager host preparation task enabled the VXLAN capability and established VTEPs
    As VMs are connected to the network the UWA is used to inform the NSX controller and update the required table
    all communications are SSL ecnrypted
    Runs as a daemon on the hosts called netcpa
    the UWA is not used to manage the distributed firewall. NSX Manager communicates with the vsfwd daemon directly
