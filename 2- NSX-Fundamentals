2-1 introduction to NSX
  Virtualizing Key Network Functions
    Logical Switches
      vxlan capability              // establish l2 ethernet network can you actually teriverse a l3 physical network
    Distributed Logical Router    // two vm are in different network but they are on the same host there traffic never to leave that host
    Distributed Firewall          // microsegmentation , filer rules that enforced vNIC level , if traffic is leaving a VM and is bound for some other VM that is connected to the same logical sw
    Edge Services                 // 
      Firewall 
      Load Balacer
      IPSEC
      L2
      SSL VPN
      MORE
    integration with third Party Vendors
    REST API for Cloud Management Platforms
  The Multiple Planes of NSX
    Data Plane              // Logical Switches, Distributed Logical Router, Distributed Firewall, NSX Edge
                            // component that are responsible for passing traffic, if they fail there is an impact on service 
    Control Plane           // DLR Control VM, NSX Controller
                            // dont have direct impact on traffic if they fail
    Management Plane        // vCenter, NSX Manager (Always has a 1-to-1 relationship with vCenter)
                            // no impact on network traffic if they fail, they just impact on our ability to manage
  what are Kernel Modules?
    Kernel Modules are made up of VIBs.     // piece of software 
    they run directly within the hypervisor
    
  NSX Kernel Modules are pushed to hosts by NSX Manager
    VXLAN
    Distributed Logical Router
    Distributed Firewall
