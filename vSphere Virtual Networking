Virtual Networking
  VM
  vNIC                      // provide connectivity to VMs
  Port Group                // define settings like VLAN membership, security policy, VM on same port group can commiunicate with each other without that trafic leaving the ESXi host
  vmnic                     // Physical up-link, trafic need to send out external network or some VM on deffernt network
  vSphere Standard Switch   // MTU = 9000
  Physical Switch           // MTU = 1524 , so we need jumbo frame switch supported
  
  vm kernek                 // created on vStandard or vDistributed Switchs, it used for traffic like vMotion, ip storage, FT, VSAN, management
    Management vmk0
    vMotion vmk1
    FT Logging vmk2
  
  
vSphere Standard Switches
  VMNIC Link State Failure              // recognize by vSphere easily
  Upstream Device Failure               // recognize by vSphere easily
  
  NIC Teaming by Originating Port ID    //
  NIC Teaming by Source MAC Hash
  NIC Teaming by IP Hash
  
  Traffic Shaping                       // Peak Bandwidth, Average Bandwith, barse zise
  
  Security Setting
    /* Switch setting are global, and are overridden by port group level */
    Forged Transmits                    // Allow MAC spoofing for outbound traffic
    MAC Address Changes                 // Allow MAC spooging for inbound traffic
    Promiscuous Mode                    // Allows sniffing of all traffic on the virtual switch
    
  Multiple TCP/IP Stacks
    Default TCP/IP Stack is used for management, and all other types of traffic by default
    vMotion TCP/IP Stack
      you can configure vMotion to use this stack
      this allows vMotion traffic to be pointed to a different IP Network
      this can be useful for features like long distance vMotion
    Provisioning TCP/IP Stack
      cold migration, cloning, and Snapshots
    Create a custom TCP/IP Stacks and associate VMkernel ports with it
